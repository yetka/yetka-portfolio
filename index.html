              <p>There is an interesting story behind it..</p>
              <p>For more than 10 years I was working as a veterinary surgeon in my home country. I was running my own pet clinic for 5 years. Then I met my husband. And it changed everything. He got an offer from his company to move to Seattle. It seemed to be a creazy idea to me. It was risky.</p>
              <p>I took this risk. I am not a person who wants to regret not trying something in my life.</p>
              <p>But there was some issue. I couldn't work in my previous proffesion anymore. To do that I would have to go back to veterinary school. It helped me to realize that being a student again can be very exciting. I started thinking about learning something completely new. Something that, as my previous vocation, helps people in visible way and has a stong impract to their everyday life.</p>
              <p>This is a reason why I made my decision to start programming.</p>

              <br>
              <p>At my time at Epicodus I understood that being a good programmer is based on neverending curiosity.</p>
              <p>I realized that it was more important to me to understand how programming languages are working in general rather than become a master in one of them.</p>
              <p>I was facing new and complicated problems each day and learned how to find the answers by myself. Most of all I learned how to learn efficiently.</p>
              <p>I was either working in group, in pair and by myself. This taught me how to be kind and compassionate to colleagues and how to appreciate this vast diversity of people around my workplace.</p>
              <p>My primary interests are <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>Angular2+</strong> and <strong>React</strong> but I stay open to any new challenges.</p>
